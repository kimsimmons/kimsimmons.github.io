# #100DaysOfCode

I decided to take on the 100 days of code challenge.  

100DaysOfCode is a challenge that was started by a developer named Alexander Kallaway.  The reason for the challenge is to grow as a developer by coding at least 1 hour everyday for 100 days.  There are quite a few rules for it, one being to code on actual projects, not tutorials.  Another being posting on twitter daily and also pushing your progress to github.  I have tweaked the rules a little to fit my goals at the moment.  I am coding in my spare time while also working full time job so it is a major win to code for 1 hour a day.  

###My goals for this challenge

1. Code 1 hour a day
2. Commit and push progress to github
3. Blog about it. (with updates as I progress through the challenge)

I look forward to updating you with the progress.  If you would like to read more about the challenge or join in, here is a link to an article on Medium from Alexander explaning the details.
