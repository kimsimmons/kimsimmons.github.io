This is a simple solution to installing emmet on Sublime Text 3.  I found this solution as a comment on a blog.  I just wanted to repost for referencing later.  Hope it helps. 


"Installing from ST3 Package Manager is so easy.
Step 1: Press CTRL + SHIFT + P (or "COMMAND + SHIFT + P" on Mac)
Step 2: Type Install Package
Step 3: Type "Emmet" and Click on it.
Step 4: Restart Sublime Text 3. Done. :)"


Happy coding,
