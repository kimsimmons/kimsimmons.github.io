It's been a few months since I attended my first hackathon.  It was a hackathon specifically for those who are new to coding and wanted to try to get their feet wet by building an app at a hackathon.

The hackathon had around 50 participants, male and female.  After wandering around the room looking for a team to join, I was graciously brought in to a team of local coding bootcamp students.  They were super supportive and welcoming to me eventhough I only knew HTML, CSS and a little javascript, no back end.  The app we created was in Ruby on Rails.  

The objective of the hackathon was to build an app for a local non-profit.  I'm not certain I am able to state which non-profit here, so I am leaving them anonymous.

After the scope of the project was explained by the owners of the non-profit, we began coding the app.  We started with some written mock ups to plan out what we were doing.  We then split ourselves up into front end and back end groups within our larger team of 6.  We each took a page of the app and got to work.  

Well, a few hours later most of us got stuck on our various pages.  I mostly got stuck because of software issues -- I had trouble getting the app to work on my local machine.  I could not get the database to work locally.  I even had around 4 or 5 developers try for hours to get it to work, but my machine just would not cooperate. We eventually got the issue resolved, so I was able to continue working.  So that was roadblock number one.  

Road block number two is that I felt that I was WAY in over my head.  My team was very supportive throughout the entire day.  They were willing to help when I had questions for them. Though our team did not win, it was a HUGE learning experience.

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>


1. Learn basic Github commands.  This was our first time working with our own branches and merging them with master, pulling the changes, etc. It took a little bit to figure out the flow of github within a team context.

2. Work in pairs/pair program your features together.  I feel that one of the biggest challenges came when we each tried to take one page of our app vs having two people work on a page together.  Towards the end, we began working together/pairing and things got much easier.  I truly saw the value in working as a team for a common goal that day.

3. You meet great people at hackahtons.  By the end of the day I met a lot of great developers in the area and have since seen a few people at various meetups.  Also a few of us created a coding group where we make projects together, I'll explain that in a future post.

All in all, it was a great experience.   I learned a lot of practical lessons that I will take with me as I continue to learn.  Looking forward to my next hackathon.
